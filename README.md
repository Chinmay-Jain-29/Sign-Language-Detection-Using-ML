# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-ML
A machine learning-based system that detects and translates sign language gestures into text or speech using computer vision. Trained on hand gesture datasets for accurate recognition, enabling real-time interaction and promoting inclusive communication through gesture interpretation.

🧠 Sign Language Detection Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on developing a real-time sign language detection system using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system captures hand gestures through a webcam, processes the images using image classification or keypoint detection models, and translates recognized signs into corresponding text or speech output.

🔍 Key Features
Real-time Detection: Detects sign language gestures live using a webcam feed.

Machine Learning Powered: Utilizes trained ML models (e.g., CNN, MediaPipe, etc.) for accurate gesture recognition.

Gesture-to-Text Conversion: Converts recognized gestures into readable text instantly.

Extensible Dataset: Supports custom datasets for recognizing various sign languages (e.g., ASL).

User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI for interacting with the system and viewing outputs.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras

MediaPipe (for hand landmark detection)

NumPy, Matplotlib

Tkinter / Streamlit / Flask (for UI, optional)

🧪 Workflow
Data Collection: Capture or use pre-existing datasets of labeled sign language gestures.

Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and augment images for better training performance.

Model Training: Train a RF or use pre-trained models to classify hand gestures.

Detection & Inference: Use webcam input to detect and classify gestures in real-time.

Output: Display translated text or convert it to speech using a text-to-speech engine.

📁 Use Cases
Interactive learning tools

Gesture-based interfaces

Inclusive apps for non-verbal communication

🚀 Future Improvements
Support for full sign language sentences and grammar

Multi-hand gesture support
